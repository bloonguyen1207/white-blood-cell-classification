# White Blood Cell SubTypes Classification

## Dataset

I only work with 'dataset2-master' from this [Kaggle Blood Cell Images](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/blood-cells)

## How it all started

So I just enter the first year of my master program in Applied Computer Science, and despite having no knowledge of whatsoever related to AI and Deep learning, I applied for Deep learning for visual computing course. After a very confusing month of the semester, I began to grasp the idea of deep learning.

As my teacher guided me, and gave me a topic to work on, I found the dataset, then tried to run [an existing source code on github by MrKhan0747](https://github.com/MrKhan0747/Blood-Cell-Subtypes-Classification/).

Now my goal for this project is to improve the result of his work, by either changing the CNN's params, or applying other methods.
